# H20-Sustainable-Tap
The H2o sustainable water tap will be designed to help reduce water waste in houses. The product will be created with a pipe that will be connected to a tap, we will be using sensors to measure the water pressure in the tap. This will allow the pressure to be reduces if too much water has been used. Also, the water tap will have keypad attached to it, which will register how much water can be used for certain number of people living in the household. This way the water will not be wasted or overused all the time. Which is a really good benefit of reducing water waste from a household or buildings from the cities.
